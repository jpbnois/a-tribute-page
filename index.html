  <p style="font-size:175%; text-align:left;">Introduction:</p>
  <p style="text-align:left; font-size:105%; font-type:Ariel;">Jackie Robinson, born January 13 1919, was a second basemen who became the first African American to play in the major leagues in the modern era. Robinson broke the baseball color line when the Brooklyn Dodgers started him at first base on April 15, 1947. The Dodgers, by playing Robinson, heralded the end of racial segregation that had relegated black players to the Negro leagues since the 1880s. Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The Hall-of-Famer first started his baseball career in the Negro League with the Kansas City Monarchs.</li>
    <li>After being called up by Branch Rickey, who was the president of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Robinson became the first African-American in the MLB system, breaking the six decade-long racial segregation in baseball and contributed to the Civil Rights Movement.</li>
    <li>Robinson made his AAA debut with the Montreal Royals Daytona Beach’s City Island Ballpark on March 17, 1946, which was an exhibition game against parent club, the Dodgers. Robinson was called up to the Dodgers six days before the 1947 season.</li>
